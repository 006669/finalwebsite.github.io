      <h2>History</h2>
        <h4>Emergence from Struggle for Independence and Cold War Rivalry</h4>
            <p>  The roots of the Vietnam War trace back to Vietnam's long struggle for independence from colonial rule, particularly against French colonialists. The Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union further complicated matters, as both superpowers sought to influence Vietnam's political trajectory to advance their own interests. This convergence of nationalist aspirations and Cold War geopolitics set the stage for the conflict.</p>
        <h4>Division into North Vietnam and South Vietnam</h4>
            <p> Following the Geneva Accords of 1954, Vietnam was temporarily divided along the 17th parallel into Communist-controlled North Vietnam, led by Ho Chi Minh, and the anti-Communist South Vietnam, backed by the United States and other Western allies. This division deepened political tensions and set the stage for armed conflict between the two regions.<p>
        <h4>Use of Guerrilla Warfare Tactics by the Viet Cong</h4>
            <p>The Viet Cong, a Communist guerrilla force operating in South Vietnam, played a crucial role in the conflict by employing unconventional warfare tactics against American and South Vietnamese forces. These tactics included ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, and the extensive use of underground tunnels, enabling the Viet Cong to effectively challenge conventional military strategies.</p>
        <h4>Gulf of Tonkin Incident:</h4>
            <p>The Gulf of Tonkin Incident in 1964 marked a significant escalation in U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. Alleged attacks on American naval vessels by North Vietnamese forces prompted Congress to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, granting President Lyndon B. Johnson broad authority to use military force in Vietnam without a formal declaration of war. This event paved the way for a substantial increase in U.S. military presence and engagement in the conflict.</p>
        <h4>Tet Offensive</h4>
            <p>The Tet Offensive of 1968 was a major turning point in the Vietnam War. Coordinated attacks by Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces targeted cities, towns, and military installations across South Vietnam during the Vietnamese New Year holiday (Tet). Although the offensive ultimately resulted in a military defeat for the Communist forces, it shattered the perception of American invincibility and significantly undermined public support for the war in the United States.</p>
        <h4>Fall of Saigon</h4>
            <p>The fall of Saigon in 1975 marked the end of the Vietnam War and the reunification of Vietnam under Communist rule. North Vietnamese forces captured the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, leading to the collapse of the South Vietnamese government and the evacuation of thousands of American personnel and Vietnamese civilians. This event symbolized the ultimate victory of the Communist forces and the failure of U.S. intervention in Vietnam.</p>
